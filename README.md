# HOW TO READ MY TEST

This repository has multiple branches. The master branch with the final answers to the test questions and several branches with the name step-X (step-0, step-1, step-3, etc ...). Each step is a decision I made to reach the final solution, so to understand how I work and how I code, instead of seeing the complete solution, I recommend that you start with the step-0 branch and after step-1 . and continue until the last step.

Hope you like the way I see the software ...

# STEP-0: Analising the desings
I have chosen to try to solve problems one and two. The reason is simple; the second part of the test, as well as problems three and four, focus on JavaScript skills, so if I don't solve problems one and two, I will miss the opportunity to show my CSS skills.

So once I've decided to focus on problem one and two the question is which of them I'll solve first. The answer is the second and the reason is because, in desing, to go from the most restrictive condition to the most permisive is easer than in the other way. You can read about the [Mobile first principle in this article](https://medium.com/@Vincentxia77/what-is-mobile-first-design-why-its-important-how-to-make-it-7d3cf2e29d00). But before I start designing the website, I need to calculate the colors and sizes of the different elements in the view. So I opened up my Sketch tool and got all this information from the mockups that were included in the project:

Now I'm ready to start with the code.
