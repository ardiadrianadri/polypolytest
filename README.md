# HOW TO READ MY TEST

This repository has multiple branches. The master branch with the final answers to the test questions and several branches with the name step-X (step-0, step-1, step-3, etc ...). Each step is a decision I made to reach the final solution, so to understand how I work and how I code, instead of seeing the complete solution, I recommend that you start with the step-0 branch and after step-1 . and continue until the last step.

Hope you like the way I see the software ...
